# Resolution devices runtime

Pending previews do not use a `resolve` tool. They finalize through plain-text `write` calls to virtual `xd://` devices implemented in `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/resolve.ts`:

- `xd://resolve` — apply the pending staged preview; body = a one-sentence reason
- `xd://reject` — discard the pending staged preview; body = a one-sentence reason

These are internal URLs, not filesystem paths. `read xd://resolve` and `read xd://reject` return a one-line usage hint. Completed device writes carry `details.xdev` metadata; consumers recover the inner result through `writeDeviceDispatch()` and `resolveDispatchDetails()`.

## Preview flows

Preview producers call `queueResolveHandler(...)` with `apply(reason)` and optional `reject(reason)` callbacks. Each preview receives a unique pending-invoker ID in `ToolChoiceQueue`, so stacked previews do not overwrite one another.

While a preview is pending, `AgentSession.nextToolChoiceDirective()` returns a soft requirement:

- `toolName: "write"`
- `satisfies: isPreviewResolutionToolCall`
- reminder from `resolve-device-reminder.md`

The model complies by writing to `xd://resolve` or `xd://reject`. A different write does not resolve the preview and is skipped or escalated by the soft-requirement lifecycle.

Dispatch invokes the pending queue head through `runResolveInvocation(...)`.

- A successful apply or discard consumes that pending invoker exactly once.
- If apply throws, the same preview is re-registered so the model can reject it or retry after fixing the cause.
- Rejecting with no pending action succeeds with `Nothing to reject; no pending action remains.`
- Resolving with no pending action throws.
- An apply callback's ordinary error becomes `ToolError("Apply failed: ...")`; an existing `ToolError` is preserved.

## Why `write` is guaranteed

Because previews ride `write`, the harness keeps `write` available whenever needed:

- `createTools(...)` auto-appends `write` when a deferrable tool such as `ast_edit` is active.

## Custom tools

Custom tools still stage previews through `pushPendingAction(...)`; the loader forwards them into `queueResolveHandler(...)`. The custom-tool preview API is unchanged except for the model-facing finalization step: follow up with a plain-text write to `xd://resolve` or `xd://reject`, not a `resolve` tool call.
