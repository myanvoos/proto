//! Bounded, content-addressed tree-sitter parse cache.
//!
//! Every structural entry point in this crate ([`crate::block`],
//! [`crate::summary`]) is dominated by one cost: `Parser::parse` over the whole
//! file. Measured on an M4 Max (release, warm page cache) that is ~13.5 ms for
//! an 81 KB / 2057-line TypeScript file and ~187 ms for a 1.05 MB file, while
//! everything else those functions do totals well under a millisecond.
//!
//! The results themselves are not cacheable: `enclosing_block_boundaries`
//! depends on the caller's visible `ranges`, which differ on every call. The
//! reusable artifact is the [`Tree`], so the cache lives here and hands out
//! cheap clones of it.
//!
//! `Tree` is `Send` but not `Sync`, so entries live behind a [`Mutex`] and the
//! lock is only ever held for a map probe, a byte comparison, and a
//! `ts_tree_copy` refcount bump — never across a parse or a tree walk.
