# Configuration

## Where the daemon lives

| | state | mount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS, Linux | `~/.local/state/protofs` (or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/protofs`) | `~/checkouts` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\protofs` | drive `O:` |

On Linux, distribution FUSE confinement only allows mounts below `$HOME`,
`/mnt`, `/media` and `/tmp`; on Windows the mount must be a free drive letter.
`state` and `mount` in `~/.proto/protofs.yml` replace the defaults,
`PROTOFS_STATE`/`PROTOFS_MOUNT` replace those, and `--state`/`--mount` win over
all. Keep state on the volume holding your repositories: `new` warns when they
differ, since files are then copied instead of cloned.

`serve -memory SIZE` (`PROTOFS_MEMORY`, default `1G`) and `serve -blob-cache
SIZE` (`PROTOFS_BLOB_CACHE`, default `512M`) size the memory tiers described in
[internals](internals.md#memory-tiers); `start` passes the environment on.

## Classes

Opening a folder classifies every path into one of four classes:

| class | in the checkout | in a snapshot | on another machine |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | as captured at open | hashed: the snapshot's identity | sent by content id |
| `cache` | the folder, live and read-only | not hashed | an empty directory, rebuilt there |
| `local` | the folder, live and read-only | not hashed | absent |
| `hidden` | absent | — | absent |

Nothing is copied to make this view. A source file is the folder's own file
while its size, mtime and inode still match the capture, and its captured
content (from the store or the repository's objects) once they do not; a file
the user adds later stays out. Cache and local paths are simply the folder as
it is now. Writes in the checkout copy up into its own upper, so the folder is
never written.

## Rules

Only `source` bytes ever leave the machine. Rules are lines of
`<class> <predicate>`; the first match wins, and a directory that gets a
non-source class is decided as one unit. The built-ins come last:

```
hidden   .DS_Store | ._* | Thumbs.db | desktop.ini
local    secret
cache    cachedir | dir & (node_modules | .venv | __pycache__ | .next | .nuxt | .turbo | .gradle | .pytest_cache | .mypy_cache | .ruff_cache | .tox)
cache    ignored & dir
local    ignored
local    size > 100MB
source   *
```

Above them, in order of precedence: `--rule` lines, the folder's
`.proto/protofs.yml`, then `~/.proto/protofs.yml`.

`protofs explain [DIR|CHECKOUT] PATH` names the deciding rule and its file and
line. `protofs plan [DIR|CHECKOUT]` shows what a launch elsewhere would take from
a git origin by content id, send from this machine, rebuild, and leave behind,
and warns when a secret-looking path is `source`. The resolved rules are frozen
with each checkout (`lock.json` in its base).

### Predicates

| predicate | holds for |
| --- | --- |
| `*.log`, `Makefile` | a glob without `/`: the base name, at any depth |
| `/build`, `docs/*.md` | a glob with a leading or inner `/`: the path from the source root |
| `out/` | a trailing `/`: directories only |
| `**` | zero or more path components; one or more at the end of a glob |
| `tracked`, `untracked`, `ignored` | in a git index; neither tracked nor ignored; excluded by gitignore rules |
| `dir`, `cachedir` | a directory; a directory holding `CACHEDIR.TAG` |
| `secret` | credential names: `.env`, `.env.*` (not `.example`, `.sample`, `.template`, `.dist`), `.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.git-credentials`, `credentials`, `credentials.json`, `credentials.toml`, `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`; directories `.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.kube`, `.docker` |
| `size > 100MB` | a file (never a directory) compared with `>`, `>=`, `<` or `<=` against an integer in `B`, `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB` (powers of 1000) or `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`, `TiB`, any case |

Globs use `*`, `?` and `[…]` (`[!…]` negates). `!` binds tightest, then `&`,
then `|`; parentheses group. A glob matches a path itself: what lies below a
directory follows from the directory, since a non-source directory decides its
whole subtree.

## Git

Git is a fact source, never a requirement. `.gitignore` files apply in any
folder, as with `rg --no-require-git`; inside a repository git's own rules
apply (`info/exclude`, `core.excludesFile`), per repository for nested ones.
Tracked files whose stat data matches the index take their ids from it without
being read, and a per-folder stat cache does the same for everything else, so
reopening a large folder hashes only what changed.

Files git converts between blob and working tree are read instead, since the
blob is not their content: filter drivers such as LFS, `ident`,
`working-tree-encoding`, and end-of-line conversion (`text`, `eol`,
`core.autocrlf`) unless the blob's size equals the file's. One
`git check-attr` (and, for end-of-line candidates, one
`git cat-file --batch-check`) per repository decides this while the walk runs.
The first capture of an LFS repository therefore stores its LFS content, and on
Windows with Git's default `core.autocrlf=true` the first capture hashes every
text file.

## Configuration file

`.proto/protofs.yml` at the source root (the repository's top level when the folder
is inside one, else the folder itself) configures that folder's checkouts.
`~/.proto/protofs.yml` in the daemon user's home has the same schema, applies to
every folder and ranks below it; it alone may also set the daemon's folders.
Both are optional. They are read when a checkout opens (`new`, `run`,
`attach DIR`) and frozen into its lock, so an edit affects only checkouts
opened afterwards; `explain` and `plan` read a folder's files as they are now
and a checkout's from its lock.

```yaml
rules: |
  source  .env.local          # carry one ignored file
  local   data/**             # keep the dataset here
  hidden  *.log & !tracked
cache:
  node_modules: { rebuild: bun install --frozen-lockfile, key: [bun.lock] }
  web/.next: { rebuild: bun run build, key: [package.json] }
env:
  image: linux-dev
  setup: [bun install]
```

| key | type | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rules` | block of rule lines | classification rules, checked before the user file's and the built-ins |
| `cache.ROOT.rebuild` | string | command that recreates cache root ROOT on another machine |
| `cache.ROOT.key` | list of paths | files whose content identifies ROOT's contents |
| `env.image` | string | environment the checkout should run in |
| `env.setup` | list of strings | commands that prepare that environment |
| `state` | path | `~/.proto/protofs.yml` only: where the daemon keeps its state |
| `mount` | path | `~/.proto/protofs.yml` only: where checkouts appear |

`rules` is a block scalar (`rules: |`) with one `<class> <predicate>` per line.
Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are skipped; `#` after whitespace
starts a comment, so `a#b` stays a glob. `explain` names a rule by file and
line (`.proto/protofs.yml:3`).

`state` and `mount` take an absolute path or one starting with `~/`, and are
read by every `protofs` command before it reaches the daemon, so changing them
points the commands at another daemon; `protofs stop` the old one first. For
example, to keep everything on a data volume:

```yaml
state: /mnt/data/.protofs
mount: /mnt/data/checkouts
```

### Cache and env

A `cache` key names a cache root: a path from the source root (`web/.next`),
or a bare name (`node_modules`) for every root with that base name; an exact
path wins. An entry does not make anything a cache path, the rules do; it says
how a cache root comes back on another machine. `plan` lists each cache root
with `rebuild: CMD` or `starts empty`, plus a hash of its `key` files, which
are relative to the root's parent directory (`web/package.json` above) and must
stay inside the source; a missing key file is hashed as missing. protofs does not
run `rebuild` itself: cache roots arrive elsewhere as empty directories.

`env` is recorded in the lock, and so changes the lock hash `plan` prints, but
protofs does not act on it.

### Precedence and errors

Rules concatenate (`--rule`, folder file, user file, built-ins) and the first
match wins. A folder `cache` entry replaces the user entry with the same key;
`env.image` and `env.setup` each replace the user's when set. A folder whose
source root is the home directory reads `~/.proto/protofs.yml` once, as its own
file. Parsing is strict: unknown keys, a list for `rules`, wrong types and
invalid predicates fail `new`, `explain` and `plan` with `FILE:LINE: message`,
e.g. `.proto/protofs.yml:3: unknown key "env.imge"`.
