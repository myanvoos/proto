# Platforms and frontends

One daemon serves every checkout as a folder of a single mount.

| OS | default frontend | `serve -proto` alternatives | needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | NFSv3 | `smb` | nothing |
| Linux | FUSE | `nfs`, `smb` (mounting them needs root) | `fusermount3` |
| Windows | WinFsp where installed and the SMB client dials only port 445, else SMB | `smb`, `winfsp` | [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev) for `winfsp` |

## NFS

NFS is served by the `nfs` package: NFSv3 with its MOUNT protocol, and
NFSv4.0, on one port. File handles are the export's stable node ids, so they
survive renames and daemon restarts. Automatic mounts use NFSv3 with
client-local locks. The macOS mount uses
`noresvport,locallocks,nobrowse,intr,rwsize=1048576` and normal attribute
caching (the client's default timeouts are 5 to 60 s). After creating or
removing a checkout the daemon `statfs`es its own mount, making the client
revalidate the export root so new checkouts show up immediately. The export
root is read-only; cross-checkout rename returns EXDEV so `mv` copies.

The server also accepts NFSv4.0 clients on the same port. These may receive
read delegations, recalled on changes through another protocol, `pull`,
reattach, checkout removal, and folder edits in cache and local paths reported
by the folder watcher (FSEvents on macOS, inotify on Linux,
ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows). Live folder paths are not delegated while
the watcher does not cover their folder: on Linux beyond the
`fs.inotify.max_user_watches` limit, or until a moved or deleted folder exists
again. NFSv4.0 is not the automatic mount: its stateful open and close traffic
substantially slows cold Cargo builds on macOS.

## FUSE

`serve -proto fuse` (the Linux default) mounts through `fusermount3`, with the
export's stable node ids as inode numbers and one-second entry and attribute
timeouts.

## SMB

`serve -proto smb` serves the `protofs` share, to guests on macOS and Linux and
to one account on Windows (below), with Unix modes, executable bits, symlinks,
byte-range locks and change notifications; macOS smbfs caches negative lookups
for about two seconds.

SMB2.1+ file leases allow read and handle caching, recalled on conflicting
opens, rename/deletion, and daemon or watched-folder changes. Unwatched live
paths are not leased. Write caching, including exclusive/batch oplocks, is not
granted: daemon-side snapshots and diffs have no client-flush barrier.
Directory leasing is not supported.

The server resolves a CREATE of an existing name with one lookup (a lookup
succeeds only through directories, so symlinked components are walked only
when it fails), opens no backend file for attribute-only and delete opens, and
answers the QUERY_INFO requests Windows sends after each CREATE from that
lookup until any command that could change a file runs, for at most a second.
CREATE and CLOSE of different names, and renames and deletions of files, run in
parallel; renames and deletions of directories, delete-on-close of directories
and creates that follow links run alone.

## Windows

### SMB

The daemon maps its share onto the mount drive (`WNetAddConnection4W`, as
`net use` does) and refuses a drive mapped elsewhere. The SMB client dials
another port only from Windows 11 24H2 (build 26100), so older builds serve on
`127.0.0.1:445`, which the Server service holds until it is stopped
(`sc config LanmanServer start= disabled` and `net stop LanmanServer /y`, from
an elevated prompt; this ends the machine's own file sharing); the daemon says
so when it cannot bind. Drive mappings belong to a logon session, so a daemon
started over ssh maps `O:` for that session only.

Windows 11 24H2 and Server 2025 refuse anonymous NTLM, guest logons and
unsigned sessions by default, so on Windows the server accepts one account,
`protofs`, with a random 128-bit password, and its sessions are NTLMv2
authenticated and signed. The password is kept in `smb-password` in the state
directory, readable by the daemon's user alone, so a mapping a previous run
left reconnects to the next; it is passed to the SMB client as an SSPI
identity, never on a command line, and never logged. Deleting the file makes
the next start create another password.

The daemon opens host files with delete sharing and renames with POSIX
semantics, so clients can rename, replace and delete files other handles hold
open, as on Unix; because Windows never renames a directory while a file below
it is open, `snap`, `fork` and `rm` first close the checkout's upper
descriptors, which reopen in the next generation.

Served on loopback, files are owned by the daemon's user and primary group,
as on the WinFsp drive, so Git's ownership check accepts checkouts with no
`safe.directory` entry. A share served on another address keeps reporting the
Unix-ID owner `S-1-22-1-0`.

### WinFsp

`serve -proto winfsp` mounts the drive through [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev), a
filesystem driver installed once per machine (installing needs an
administrator; mounting does not), as the network volume `\\protofs\O`, with no
SMB and no port. It is the Windows default where WinFsp is installed and
the SMB client dials only port 445; elsewhere SMB stays the default, being faster.

Files look as they do to Windows SMB clients: case-sensitive names,
`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY` as the owner write bit, node ids as file indexes,
symlinks as described below. Open files can be deleted and renamed over, as on
Unix. The driver caches metadata for one second and never caches data.

### Links

Both frontends report a symlink whose target is a directory with
`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY`, as NTFS directory symlinks are: Windows tools enter
only links marked so. Opened as itself, such a link counts as a directory, so
`rmdir` removes it. `CreateSymbolicLink`, `mklink /D` and junction tools
create directory links on the drive; a junction is stored as a symlink to its
target. `mklink /J` refuses network drives before asking the daemon.
A link created with a target that names its own checkout through the drive
(`O:\app\x`) or the share (`\\127.0.0.1\protofs\app\x`, as Bun writes them) is
stored relative to the link: served as written, it would lead the daemon back
into its own mount.

The SMB server follows links itself, since Windows refuses by default to
follow links between network paths. Over SMB 3 it flags an open that
followed a link at the end of its path with `SMB2_CREATE_FLAG_REPARSEPOINT`;
without the flag, Windows would describe the link by its target for its
metadata cache lifetime, and realpath in tools such as tsc and Bun would
stop seeing it.

### Unix modes and Defender

Unix mode bits that NTFS cannot hold (execute, setuid, setgid, sticky, and any
mode but 0644/0755 or their read-only forms) live in an `:protofs.mode` alternate
data stream of each upper and layer file, so they follow renames, hard links
and snapshots; the state directory must be on NTFS or ReFS for such modes. New
files get 0644 and directories 0755, as with a umask of 022.

Microsoft Defender scans every file the daemon writes into its state and every
file Windows reads over SMB; excluding the state directory
(`Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $env:LOCALAPPDATA\protofs`, as administrator)
cut a first capture of a 12k-file repository from 4.8 s to 3.7 s on the test
VM.

Defender dominates WinFsp's speed: it reads a file again on every open of a
WinFsp volume, and path exclusions do not match WinFsp volumes. In a Windows 11
arm64 VM a no-op `go build ./...` of this repository took 3.6 s with the drive
as a local disk, 1.2 s as a network volume, which Defender scans less, and
0.85 s over SMB. Excluding the opening process from Defender
(`Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess`) cut an open and close from 400 µs to
49 µs, against SMB's 53 µs.

## Live paths and metadata

Lookups of live (cache and local) paths prove that the folder's ancestor
directories are real directories, not symlinks; a proof is reused for one
second, the frontends' attribute lifetime, and live directory listings take
their entries' metadata from the listing itself. A checkout's own files are
described from its in-memory index, which every change made through protofs
refreshes; only a file open for writing is looked up on the host.

A live symlink whose absolute target lies inside the folder reads as the same
path relative to the link, so in a checkout it names the checkout's copy:
Bun on Windows links workspace packages in `node_modules` by absolute path.
Absolute targets outside the folder stay as stored. Windows junctions, in
live paths and in source alike, read as the directory symlinks they act as.
