// Package durable flushes protofs's own metadata files (state.json, pins.log,
// nodes.log and the directories holding them) to stable storage.
//
// On macOS, (*os.File).Sync issues F_FULLFSYNC, which also drains the drive's
// write cache and costs tens of milliseconds per call. protofs's metadata must
// survive a crash of the server process or the kernel, not a power cut, so
// Sync uses plain fsync(2) there, as SQLite does by default. Other platforms
// keep (*os.File).Sync. Client data written through the mounts is not
// affected: its fsync and NFS COMMIT still reach (*os.File).Sync.
